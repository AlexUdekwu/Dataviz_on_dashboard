# Final-Project-Tableau
Causes of Death - Our World In Data.
## Project/Goals
To analyse the global causes of death recorded between 2000-2019,either caused by diseases and other man-made factors that lead to high death toll.

## Process
1. Changed different data type to be uniform to each column
2. Deleted rows with no data.
3. Select only death data by country
4. Connect data to tableau
5. Calculate sum of death

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)
I chose Option 2, working on the global causes of death.
i chose this because this has been an unanswered question in my home country with daily records of deaths over the years with no solution in sight.
Question1: Global deaths across the world:
I used the generated longitude and latitude to display the world map from the high deaths to low deaths using a bubble chart to categorize.

Question 2: Countries with highest death in continents:
I analyzed this by using the sum of death and the year of study to determine the figures and displayed data on a line chart to clearly identify the countries with the highest deaths in the 6 continents.

Question3: Countries with highest deaths by terrorism: 
I analyzed data using generated longitude and latitude as well as the entity compring of deaths by terrorism to distinguish only the top10 countries with highest death rates by terrorism and displayed data using a bar chart. 

Question 4: Deaths by HIV across countries:
I analysed the deaths recorded by the disease over the years of study to determine the year that recorded the highest deaths caused by the disease.

Question 5: Countries with highest deaths by execution:
I used the entity comprising of deaths by terrorism to distinguish only the top10 countries with highest death rates by execution and displayed data using bar chart.

I also identified the trend showing the death reduction caused by HIV and the possible outcome in future years due to actions that have been taken place to minimise deaths by this disease.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

The process of cleaning the data to ensure uniformity.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)

To also analyse the causes of death by alcohol, accidents and malaria and identify possible trends that could be significant to lead to reduction of deaths by these factors.
